## Arcane Firearm

At 5th level, You know how to turn a wand, staff, or rod into an arcane firearm, a conduit for your destructive spells.

When you finish a long rest, you can use woodcarver’s tools to carve special sigils into a wand, staff, or rod and thereby turn it into your arcane firearm.

The sigils disappear from the object if you later carve them on a different item.

The sigils otherwise last indefinitely.

You can use your arcane firearm as a spellcasting focus for your artificer spells.

When you cast an artificer spell through the firearm, roll a d8, and you gain a bonus to one of the spell’s damage rolls equal to the number rolled.

## Explosive Cannon

Starting at 9th level, every eldritch cannon you create is more destructive:

- The cannon’s damage rolls all increase by 1d8.
- As an action, you can command the cannon to detonate if you are within 60 feet of it. Doing so destroys the cannon and forces each creature within 20 feet of it to make a Dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC, taking 3d8 force damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.

## Fortified Position

By 15th level, you’re a master at forming well-defended emplacements using Eldritch Cannon:

- You and your allies have half cover while within 10 feet of a cannon you create with Eldritch Cannon, as a result of a shimmering field of magical protection that the cannon emits.
- You can now have two cannons at the same time. You can create two with the same action (but not the same spell slot), and you can activate both of them with the same bonus action. You determine whether the cannons are identical to each other or different. You can’t create a third cannon while you have two.
